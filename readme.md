# Simple Learning Web App

This is a simple web app designed for learning purposes. The user uploads a text file containing two columns, question and answer. The first question gets displayed and after a successful user input, another one is displayed. The user iterates through the list and at the end, they can see that they have completed the whole list.

## Installation

No special installation requirements are needed as this is a standalone web application. Simply extract all files from the ZIP archive to a directory of your choice.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
2. Use the "Upload File" button to upload a text file. This file should contain two columns: "Question" and "Answer."
3. After uploading the file, the first question will be displayed.
4. Enter the correct answer in the provided input field and press "Submit."
5. If the answer is correct, the next question will be displayed. Repeat this process until all questions have been answered.
